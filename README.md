📂 Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to train and evaluate Decision Tree models for both classification and regression tasks using scikit-learn. Decision Trees are intuitive models that split data into branches based on feature thresholds, making them easy to interpret and visualize.

⚙️ Requirements
Python 3.8+

Libraries:

numpy

pandas

scikit-learn

matplotlib (optional, for visualization)

🔍 Model Evaluation
Classifier Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, Confusion Matrix.

Regressor Metrics: R² Score, Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

Always use train-test split or cross-validation to avoid overfitting.

🚀 Tips for Better Performance
Tune hyperparameters:

max_depth

min_samples_split

min_samples_leaf

Use GridSearchCV for automated tuning.

Consider Random Forests or Gradient Boosting for improved accuracy.
